		<h2>Count William of warwick</h2>
		<p> In the fertile, rich and lovely island of England there lived a
most valiant knight, noble by his lineage and much more for his
courage.  In his great wisdom and ingenuity he had served the
profession of chivalry for many years and with a great deal of
honor, and his fame was widely known throughout the world.  His
name was Count William of Warwick.  This was a very strong knight
who, in his virile youth, had practiced the use of arms,
following wars on sea as well as land, and he had brought many
battles to a successful conclusion.</p>
